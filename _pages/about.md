I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [SSLab@Gatech](https://gts3.org/pages/people.html) under the supervision of [Prof. Taesoo Kim](https://taesoo.kim/), and the Java bug finding team leader of [Team-Atlanta](https://team-atlanta.github.io/) (1st place winner of [AIxCC Competition](https://aicyberchallenge.com/) with $4,000,000 award). Prior to this, I was a postdoc and Ph.D. student at the CCDS at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) under the guidance of [Prof. Liu Yang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/) since 2019.

My research expertise mainly centers around building tools factilitating vulnerability detection:

- **Fuzz Driver Generation**: LLM4FDG (ISSTA 24), Rubick (<img src="https://cenzhang.github.io/images/award.gif" style="width: 13px;">USENIX Sec 23), APICraft (<img src="https://cenzhang.github.io/images/award.gif" style="width: 13px;">USENIX Sec 21)
- **Firmware Analysis**: BVFinder (<img src="https://cenzhang.github.io/images/award.gif" style="width: 13px;">ICSE 24), EQUAFL (ISSTA 22), FirmGuide (ASE 21), ECMO (CCS 21)
- **Model-Based Vulnerability Detection**: Rengar (Oakland 23), Endwatch (<img src="https://cenzhang.github.io/images/award.gif" style="width: 13px;">ASE 23)
- **General Fuzzing Improvements**: Medusa (WWW 24), BiFF (<img src="https://cenzhang.github.io/images/award.gif" style="width: 13px;">ASE 21), MUZZ (USENIX Sec 20), Cerebro (FSE 19)

My works have received several awards from both academia and industry, such as the <font color="red">AIxCC 1st place Winner</font>, <font color="red">ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Awards</font> of ASE 2023 and ICSE 2024, <font color="red">2021 Most Influential Research Paper of Ant Finance</font>, and <font color="red">1st Award of Prototype Competition, Free Style Track, NASAC (ChinaSoft) 2019</font>.

I was also working as Project Co-Investigator for some research projects and mentoring several Ph.D students.
In the future, I plan to explore more possibilities on **vulnerability detection**, such as modeling new kinds of vulnerbilities, exploring LLM-assisted approaches, etc.
